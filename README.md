## 🚀 Getting Started & Deploying to Firebase

You can develop, test, and deploy this application for free, even from a mobile phone, using a cloud-based development environment like GitHub Codespaces.

### Prerequisites

- A [GitHub Account](https://github.com) (free).
- A [Firebase Account](https://firebase.google.com) (free "Spark Plan" is sufficient).

### Development and Deployment Steps

1.  **Fork this Repository:**
    Start by creating your own copy (fork) of this project on GitHub.

2.  **Open in Codespaces:**
    - In your newly forked repository on GitHub, click the green `<> Code` button.
    - Go to the `Codespaces` tab and click `Create codespace on main`.
    - This will open a full VS Code-like editor and terminal directly in your browser, which works on your phone.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Once the Codespace is loaded, a terminal will appear at the bottom. Type the following command to install all necessary packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    - In the file explorer on the left, create a new file named `.env.local`.
    - Go to your Firebase project's settings in the Firebase Console and find your web app's configuration keys.
    - Paste them into the `.env.local` file like this:

    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
    ```
    **Note:** The Google Maps API Key is optional.

5.  **Run the Development Server (Optional):**
    To test the app inside the Codespace, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Codespaces will create a public URL for you to open and test the app.

6.  **Deploy to Firebase App Hosting (Go Live!):**
    - **Install Firebase Tools:** In the Codespaces terminal, run:
      ```bash
      npm install -g firebase-tools
      ```
    - **Login to Firebase:** Run this command and follow the link to log in to your Google account in a new tab:
      ```bash
      firebase login
      ```
    - **Initialize App Hosting:** Run this command to link your app to Firebase:
      ```bash
      firebase init apphosting
      ```
      The CLI will guide you through selecting your Firebase project.
    - **Deploy!** Run the final command:
      ```bash
      firebase deploy
      ```
      After a few minutes, the CLI will give you your live URL (e.g., `https://your-project-id.web.app`). Congratulations, your app is now live for the world to see!
