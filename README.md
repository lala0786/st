## 🚀 Getting Started & Deploying (Critical Steps)

To run and deploy this application, you **MUST** configure your Firebase project keys. It's a simple process.

### Prerequisites

- A [GitHub Account](https://github.com) (free).
- A [Firebase Account](https://firebase.google.com) (free "Spark Plan" is sufficient).

### Step 1: Create a Firebase Project

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  Click **Add project**, give it a name (like "Pithampur Homes"), and follow the on-screen steps.
3.  Once your project is created, you'll be on the project dashboard.

### Step 2: Get Your Firebase Web App Config

1.  On your project dashboard, click the **Web icon** (`</>`) to create a new web app.
2.  Give your app a nickname (e.g., "Pithampur Homes Web") and click **Register app**.
3.  **This is the important part:** Firebase will show you an `firebaseConfig` object with your keys. It looks like this:
    ```javascript
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "AIzaSy...",
      authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "your-project-id",
      storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "...",
      appId: "1:...:web:..."
    };
    ```
4.  **Copy these keys.**

### Step 3: Add Keys to Your Project

1.  In your code editor on the left, find the file named `.env.local`. If it doesn't exist, **create a new file** with that exact name.
2.  Paste the keys you copied from Firebase into the `.env.local` file. **Make sure to add `NEXT_PUBLIC_` before each key name.** It should look exactly like this:

    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_from_firebase
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain_from_firebase
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_from_firebase
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket_from_firebase
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id_from_firebase
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id_from_firebase
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id_from_firebase
    ```
    **Note:** The Google Maps API Key is optional and can be added later if you want maps to work.

### Step 4: Enable Authentication Methods

1.  In the Firebase Console, go to **Build > Authentication**.
2.  Click the **Sign-in method** tab.
3.  Enable the following providers:
    *   **Google**
    *   **Email/Password**
    *   **Phone**

**That's it! Your app is now configured and all features, including Google Login, will work.**

## ☁️ Deploying to Firebase App Hosting (Go Live!)

Once your app is configured, you can deploy it with a few commands.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    In the terminal, run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Deploy!**
    Run the final command:
    ```bash
    firebase deploy
    ```
    After a few minutes, the CLI will give you your live URL (e.g., `https://your-project-id.web.app`). Congratulations, your app is live!
